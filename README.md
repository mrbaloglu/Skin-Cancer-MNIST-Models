# Skin-Cancer-MNIST-Models
This repository contains the preprocessing code of the images of the HAM10000 Skin Cancer MNIST Dataset, and classification models in notebooks.

For the preprocessing of the images into the numpy arrays see the descriptions in data_process.py . The notebooks contain Convolutional Neural Network and Logistic Regression Models for the classification of the dataset. The notebooks are generated and trained in GoogleColab environment.

Overview of these models can be seen in the following figures uploaded in the repository.
